## 🔐 Key Concepts:
- Users, Groups, Roles
- Policies: Inline vs Managed
- MFA, Root Account Best Practices

## 📄 Example Policy:
- `readonly-policy.json`: allows read-only access to S3, EC2, RDS

## 🧠 What I learned:
IAM is the security foundation of AWS. Least privilege is a critical design principle.
